h1. Awknet Commons.

The goal of this projects is create a common repository of code that I can reuse. Maybe it could be usefull for someone, maybe not. Anyway, feel free to explore the code.

h1. Tools.

At first time, I am using java. There some scripts (sh) and other things usefull. Enjoy it!

h1. TODO.

* Library:
** Fix doc and src download - not working in the same way that bin's file download.
** Maybe, the best approach is separat by type, eg.:
*** Apache Commons;
*** Zip files;
*** Among others;

* Java install

* IDE install

h1. Requirements.

*Hint*: Using PT_BR as main to describe all requirements - maybe, some times the requirements described in english.

h2. Folder Structure.

(Jefferson Campos): I, *developer*, wish to have +a nice folder tree, customized and standart to all my projects+ because _it help my work be more fast and simple_.

Basic tree:
universal/
> projects/
>> lib/
>> GROUP_OF_PROJECTS [abacomm | pms | awknet | UFSCAR]
>>> <PROJECT_NAME>/
>>>> build/
>>>> ide/
>>>> scm/
>>>>> trunk/
>>>>>> doc/
>>>>>> src/
>>>>>>> java/
>>>>>>> db/
>>>>>>> web/
>>>>>> test/
>>>>>> README
>>>>>> COPYING
>>>>> tags/
>>>>> branches/


h2. Lib Folder
lib/
> version/
>> doc/
>> src/
