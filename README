h1. Awknet Commons.

The goal of this projects is create a common repository of code that I can reuse. Maybe it could be usefull for someone, maybe not. Anyway, feel free to explore the code.

h1. Tools.

At first time, I am using java. There some scripts (sh) and other things usefull. Enjoy it!

h1. TODO.

* Create a .deb for this program.

* Library:
** Fix doc and src download - not working in the same way that bin's file download.
** Fix if data file don't have some info (eg. src or doc)
** Maybe, the best approach is separat by type, eg.: java, zip files, etc;
*** Create some functions to fix some errors (file extract errors)

* Java install

* IDE install

h1. Requirements.

*Hint*: Using PT_BR as main to describe all requirements - maybe, some times the requirements described in english.

h2. Folder Structure.

(Jefferson Campos): I, *developer*, wish to have +a nice folder tree, customized and standart to all my projects+ because _it help my work be more fast and simple_.

Basic tree:
$HOME/
>universal/
>> projects/
>>> lib/
>>> GROUP_OF_PROJECTS [abacomm | pms | awknet | ufscar]
>>>> <PROJECT_NAME>/
>>>>> build/
>>>>> ide/
>>>>> scm/
>>>>>> trunk/
>>>>>>> doc/
>>>>>>> src/
>>>>>>>> java/
>>>>>>>> db/
>>>>>>>> web/
>>>>>>> test/
>>>>>>> README
>>>>>>> COPYING
>>>>>> tags/
>>>>>> branches/


h2. Lib Folder
$HOME
>universal/
>> projects/
>>> lib/
>>>> *lang* - [java|C|C++|ruby|python|etc]
>>>> version/
>>>>> doc/
>>>>> src/
>>>>> bin/
>>>>> download/
